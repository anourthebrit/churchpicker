# churchpicker

A web app that asks people questions to help determine the things they would and wouldnâ€™t like, and then make a recommendation for them with churches that they may not have selected for themselves until approaching it this way. Once a recommendation has been made, the app would then link to a more established church directory website with filters applied based on the answers given so the user can see churches that are a potential match in their area.
